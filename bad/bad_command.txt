Run

python run.py 2 5 small_test/test_vertices.txt small_test/test_edges.txt

Any configuration is fine

Then run

python node.py 0

python node.py 1

such that there is less than 2 seconds between running those two commands

You might see something like

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 801, in __bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 754, in run
    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)
  File "node.py", line 423, in worker
    local_cur_min_proposal = cur_min_proposal
NameError: global name 'cur_min_proposal' is not defined


or something else.
